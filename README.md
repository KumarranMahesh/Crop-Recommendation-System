# Crop Recommendation System

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental and soil parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about different crops and their respective growing conditions.

## Overview
The Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest the most appropriate crop to cultivate under given conditions. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation steps to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
- P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
- K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil
- temperature: Temperature in degree Celsius
- humidity: Relative humidity in %
- ph: pH value of the soil
- rainfall: Rainfall in mm
- label: Type of crop

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
